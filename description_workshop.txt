[h1]About [/h1]

This is a mod to help find items that NPCS sell.


Doing /findItem [item] will try to find which NPC sells the item. You use the OpenCommand keybind to automatically OpenChat with "/findItem" in it.
This also supports the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3418974288&searchtext=npc+finder] NPC Finder [/url] mod made by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/erky1952] Erky [/url]. If your results belong to only one npc, an arrow will appear pointing to that npc.
[h2]Examples: [/h2]
[list]
    [*]"/findItem bubble"
    [*]"/findItem Copper Shortsword"
